# MeshSim
Simulator for mesh RF networks for testing algorithm and protocol designs.

This simulation implements a true mesh topology algorithm developed for mapping RF Mesh networks.  The program has terminal-style input for several commands explained clearly in the 'h' help menu.  I recommend starting there.  If you have a question about the program or how it works, please feel free to contact me via GitHub.  Thanks for your interest! Enjoy!
